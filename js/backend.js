// REquest data from a backend
// Put simply, HTTP is a protocol which allows kus to send info around the web. For example, whenyour browse asks for https://domain. HTTP requests come in different f;avours, suing different verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE are the four most commmon). The kind of request your browswer makes (and the kind we ill use this chapter) is a GET request.  a GET request generally means we would like the server to send us some data.

// Dont worry too much about the details for now: once you've seen HTTP requests in practice, it becomes a lot easier to understand.

// AJAX stands for Asynchronus JavaScript and XML. Now there's a mouthful.

// Basically, it is a system that allows us to send requests and handle the responces from within our javascript code. Fot example, when you leave a comment on a blog post, when you send or receieve a e-mail on a webmail service like gnail, or when a webpage updates itself without refreshimg , it is often using AJAX to do so.

// Two other intialism you may see in this context are API and JSON

    // API stand for Appliaction Programming Interface. Many companies and services provide APIs which will react in specific ways when we send them HTTP requests. You will come accrosssa few in this course

    // a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of apps that access the featurea and data of a Opperating system, app, or other service.

    // JSON, or JavaSCript OBject Notaion, is a way of representingand handling data as a JavaScript object. It is extremely useful for sending and recieving data over the internet, as it makesit easy to deal with structures data.
