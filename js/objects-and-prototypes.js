// In addition tonits special properties, every javascript object has a internal property called a prototype. This is a link (known as a reference) to anouther object. Whe trying to access a property that does not existin a object, Javascript tries to find this property in the prototype of this object.

var anObject = {
    a:2
};


// Create anoutherObject using anObject as a prototype
var anoutherObject = Object.create(anObject);

console.log(anoutherObject.a);  //will show two

// the Javascript statement Object.create() is used to create the object anoutherObject based on the prototype until we get to the end of the prototype chain. If the property was found in objects, access retirns to the value undefined.

// Create anoutherObject using anObject as a prototype

console.log(anoutherObject.a); // will be 2
console.log(anoutherObject.b); // will be undefined

// This type of relationship betweeen Javascript projects is called delegation: an object delegates part of its operation to its prototype.

// Create a game that has charcters, players and enemies. A player can atk a onpointerenter, yhe reverse is true as well.
// If char sees lp decrease from force of atk must see.
// if char lp runs out game ends or char is elimated.
